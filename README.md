Provider for [libmangal](https://github.com/luevano/libmangal) written in go.

Most of the code/functionality is based heavily on implementations from [Belphemur/mangal](https://github.com/Belphemur/mangal) (which in turn comes from [metafates/mangal](https://github.com/metafates/mangal)) adapted to work with [libmangal](https://github.com/luevano/libmangal)'s [mangal](https://github.com/luevano/mangal).
